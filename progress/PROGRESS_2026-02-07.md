# Progress Snapshot — Placement Intelligence Portal
Date: 2026-02-07

## High-level Status
- Phase: Backend complete, Frontend pending → System at **Beta** (backend production-ready).
- Overall: Core APIs, DB schema, auth, RBAC, experience workflow, and basic analytics primitives implemented.

## Completed (Concise)
- Authentication: JWT RS256 + bcrypt, register/login, profile endpoints.
- Authorization: `roleMiddleware` (admin, student, junior) and ownership checks.
- Company & Drive: CRUD APIs + drive scheduling fields.
- Experience Module: submit/list/get/update; approval workflow endpoints (approve/reject).
- Database: PostgreSQL schema created (`backend/setup_database.sql`) — 10 tables + indexes.
- Utilities: token, password, logger, query helpers; global error/validation middleware.
- DevOps helpers: `scripts/init-db.js`, `scripts/test-connection.js`.

## Key Files
- `backend/server.js`, `backend/config/database.js`, `backend/models/*`, `backend/services/*`, `backend/routes/*`, `backend/setup_database.sql`, `docs/API_ENDPOINTS.md`.

## Pending / Next Priority (Short)
1. Frontend (React) scaffolding and pages (Auth UI, Admin dashboard, Student portal, Junior insights).
2. Analytics engine: aggregation queries, scheduled cache population, dashboard endpoints.
3. Preparation roadmap algorithm using `rounds`/`topics_master`/`skills_master` data.
4. CI/CD, containerization (`Docker`), monitoring, and production hardening (secrets, SSL, backups).

## Quick Next Steps (Today)
- Run DB verification: `node scripts/test-connection.js` and ensure `psql` connectivity.
- Start backend: from `backend/` run `npm run dev` (ensure `.env` credentials match DB user).
- Kick off frontend scaffold: `npx create-react-app frontend` (or equivalent) and wire auth endpoints.
