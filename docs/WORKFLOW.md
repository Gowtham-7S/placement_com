## 7. ANALYTICS WORKFLOW: DATA TO INSIGHTS

```
APPROVAL EVENT:
Admin approves experience #101 → Trigger analytics update

STEP 1: TRIGGER
         ├─ Event: Experience approved
         ├─ Endpoint: PUT /api/admin/submissions/:id/approve
         ├─ Handler: Create approval record
         └─ Trigger: analyticsService.updateCache(experience_id)

STEP 2: DATA EXTRACTION
         ├─ Query: SELECT all approved experiences for company
         ├─ Join: With rounds and questions tables
         ├─ Filter: Only where approval_status = 'approved'
         ├─ Get: All topics, questions, difficulties, skills
         └─ Data: Ready for aggregation

         SELECT e.id, e.company_name, r.round_type, r.difficulty_level,
                q.category, q.difficulty, r.skills_tested
         FROM experiences e
         JOIN rounds r ON e.id = r.experience_id
         JOIN questions q ON r.id = q.round_id
         WHERE e.approval_status = 'approved'
         AND e.drive_id IN (SELECT id FROM drives WHERE company_id = 1)

STEP 3: ANALYTICS COMPUTATION

         A. TOPIC FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
         ├─ Count: Occurrences of each topic
         ├─ Query:
         │  SELECT q.category as topic, COUNT(*) as frequency
         │  FROM questions q
         │  WHERE ... (approved experiences only)
         │  GROUP BY q.category
         │  ORDER BY frequency DESC
         │
         ├─ Calculate: Percentage
         │  frequency = 450, total = 500 → 90%
         │
         └─ Result: [
              { topic: "Data Structures", frequency: 450, percentage: 90 },
              { topic: "Algorithms", frequency: 390, percentage: 78 },

         │  FROM rounds r
         │  WHERE ... (approved)
         │  GROUP BY r.difficulty_level
         │
         ├─ Calculate: Percentages
         │  easy: 100/500 = 20%
         │  medium: 250/500 = 50%
         │  hard: 150/500 = 30%
         │
         └─ Result: { easy: 20%, medium: 50%, hard: 30% }

         C. SKILLS MATRIX
         ├─ Extract: skills from JSON column
