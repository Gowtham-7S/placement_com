# Project Status Memory Bank

## Current Context
- **Status:** Active UI development session in progress.
- **Focus:** Dashboard styling polish, module completions, and UX improvements.

## Latest Changes
- **(2026-02-27) Dashboard UI Overhaul (All 3 portals — Admin, Student, Junior):**
  - Unified dark sidebar (`#0f172a`) with branded gradient logo badge
  - Active nav item: left-border accent + color-coded icon (blue/violet/emerald)
  - Top sticky header bar with page title, date, notification bell
  - Sidebar footer: logout-only button (user profile removed from sidebar, now shown in navbar)
  - Navbar right section: Name + Role text + colored avatar (no logout in navbar)

- **(2026-02-27) Junior CompanyBrowser improvements:**
  - Stats banner → white cards with MUI icons, subtitle labels, border/shadow
  - Company list → 2-column grid cards with selection rate progress bar, CTC badge, hover accent strip
  - Badge chip replaces "(N with reports)" text
  - Grid collapses to 1-col when only 1 result
  - Enhanced search bar with SearchIcon

- **(2026-02-27) Admin Analytics Page (`AdminAnalyticsPage.jsx`):**
  - Dedicated analytics tab (previously duplicated the Dashboard tab)
  - KPI row: Avg CTC, Total Submissions, Overall Selection Rate, Companies Tracked
  - Company-wise breakdown table: submissions, selections, selection rate bar, confidence score
  - Recent activity feed

- **(2026-02-27) Admin Experiences Module (`AdminExperienceManagement.jsx`):**
  - Previously showed blank placeholder
  - Full-stack fix: patched `Experience.getByApprovalStatus` to support `null` status (all records)
  - Added `ExperienceService.getAllSubmissions()`, `ExperienceController.getAllSubmissions()`
  - Added `GET /admin/submissions/all` route
  - Frontend: searchable by company, filterable by status, paginated table

- **(2026-02-27) Admin Dashboard Module Icons:**
  - Replaced emoji icons (🏢📢📄⏳) with MUI SVG icons in `AdminAnalytics.jsx`
  - Section headers now have icon prefixes

## Error Log
- `DriveEta` MUI icon doesn't exist → replaced with `Campaign` for "Active Drives"
- `Placeholder` component left in `AdminDashboard.jsx` after all tabs got real components → removed
- `PeopleIcon` imported but unused in `CompanyBrowser.jsx` → removed
- `Experience.getByApprovalStatus` hardcoded `'pending'` status → refactored to accept `null` for all-status queries
